```typescript
// Server-side API calls in Next.js API routes for security
// JWT token generation kept server-side
// Client-side React hooks for video session management
// Proper cleanup on component unmount
// TypeScript interfaces for all Vonage entities

// Example webhook signature verification
const verifyWebhookSignature = (authHeader: string, payload: string, secret: string): boolean => {
  const token = authHeader.replace('Bearer ', '')
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, secret)
  const payloadHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(payload).digest('hex')
  return decoded.payload_hash === payloadHash
}
```

#### Security Implementation
- Environment variables with Zod validation for configuration
- Webhook signature verification with timestamp checks
- CORS configuration for production environments
- Never expose private keys client-side

#### Scalability Patterns
- Exponential backoff for API calls (maximum 5 retries)
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Message queues for bulk operations
- Connection pooling for video sessions
- Batch operations with rate limiting
